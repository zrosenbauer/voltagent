          We're developers, like you, and we started this project based on our
          own experiences. We've built over 15 open-source projects before this,
          and each one taught us something new. Our biggest project, Refine,
          showed us how powerful working with a community can be. During our
          time building Refine—one of us as co-founder and CTO, the other as
          Growth Lead—we saw amazing things happen when the community came
          together. That experience changed us, and we're incredibly thankful to
          everyone in the Refine community.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[#dcdcdc] leading-relaxed">
          Now, we're starting something new and exciting: VoltAgent. We know AI
          development can often feel like working with a confusing "black box,"
          regardless of the language. However, the AI ecosystem is heavily
          dominated by Python, which has more mature tools and established
          practices. We felt this left JavaScript developers without adequate
          solutions. That's why we're building VoltAgent – to bring better
          clarity and best practices specifically to the JavaScript AI world.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[#dcdcdc] leading-relaxed">
          We looked into No-Code tools too. Their visual approach to making AI
          less complex was interesting. Building workflows visually was neat and
          made things easier to understand. However, we quickly ran into
          problems: we felt locked in and couldn't customize things the way we
          wanted. We realized we needed the flexibility of code, but also the
          clear view that visual tools provided.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[#dcdcdc] leading-relaxed">
          And that's why VoltAgent exists. We're creating the tool we always
          wanted – one that combines the great developer experience you get with
          code, and the easy-to-understand insights from No-Code tools. Our goal
          is to make AI development easier, clearer, and more powerful, and we
          want to build it together with the community. We're just getting
          started and we're excited to have you join us.
