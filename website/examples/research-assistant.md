In this example, we'll build an AI research assistant agent using VoltAgent's workflow system. We'll create a multi-agent system where different AI agents collaborate to research topics and generate comprehensive reports. This demonstrates the power of workflow orchestration in building AI applications.

You'll create a research workflow that:

- Takes a research topic as input
- Uses an assistant agent to generate search queries
- Leverages a writer agent to create a professional report
- Manages data flow between agents with type safety
- Integrates with external data sources via MCP

## Setup

### 1. Create a new project

```bash
npm create voltagent-app@latest -- --example with-research-assistant
cd my-agent-app
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

After signing up for Exa, get your API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys).

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-api-key
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once your server starts successfully, you'll see the following output in your terminal:

```bash
════════════════════════════════════════════
  VOLTAGENT SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY
════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✓ HTTP Server: http://localhost:3141

  VoltOps Platform: https://console.voltagent.dev
════════════════════════════════════════════
[VoltAgent] All packages are up to date
```

The [VoltOps Platform](https://console.voltagent.dev) link will open automatically in your browser where you can interact with your AI agent.

## Complete Code

Here's the complete implementation that we'll break down step by step:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent, MCPConfiguration, VoltAgent, createWorkflowChain } from "@voltagent/core";
import { createPinoLogger } from "@voltagent/logger";
import { z } from "zod";

(async () => {
  const mcpConfig = new MCPConfiguration({
    servers: {
      exa: {
        type: "stdio",
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "mcp-remote", `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=${process.env.EXA_API_KEY}`],
      },
    },
  });

  const assistantAgent = new Agent({
    id: "assistant",
    name: "Assistant",
    instructions:
      "The user will ask you to help generate some search queries. Respond with only the suggested queries in plain text with no extra formatting, each on its own line. Use exa tools.",
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
  });

  const writerAgent = new Agent({
    id: "writer",
    name: "Writer",
    instructions: "Write a report according to the user's instructions.",
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
    tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
    markdown: true,
    maxSteps: 50,
  });

  // Define the workflow's shape: its inputs and final output
  const workflow = createWorkflowChain({
    id: "research-assistant",
    name: "Research Assistant Workflow",
    // A detailed description for VoltOps or team clarity
    purpose: "A simple workflow to assist with research on a given topic.",
    input: z.object({ topic: z.string() }),
    result: z.object({ text: z.string() }),
  })
    .andThen({
      id: "research",
      execute: async ({ data }) => {
        const { topic } = data;

        const result = await assistantAgent.generateText(
          `
          I'm writing a research report on ${topic} and need help coming up with diverse search queries.
Please generate a list of 3 search queries that would be useful for writing a research report on ${topic}. These queries can be in various formats, from simple keywords to more complex phrases. Do not add any formatting or numbering to the queries. `,
          { provider: { temperature: 1 } }
        );

        return { text: result.text };
      },
    })
    .andThen({
      id: "writing",
      execute: async ({ data, getStepData }) => {
        const { text } = data;
        const stepData = getStepData("research");
        const result = await writerAgent.generateText(
          `
        Input Data: ${text}
        Write a two paragraph research report about ${stepData?.input} based on the provided information. Include as many sources as possible. Provide citations in the text using footnote notation ([#]). First provide the report, followed by a single "References" section that lists all the URLs used, in the format [#] <url>.
      `
        );

        return { text: result.text };
      },
    });

  // Create logger
  const logger = createPinoLogger({
    name: "with-mcp",
    level: "info",
  });

  // Register with VoltOps
  new VoltAgent({
    agents: {
      assistant: assistantAgent,
      writer: writerAgent,
    },
    workflows: {
      assistant: workflow,
    },
    logger,
  });
})();
```

Let's understand each part of this implementation:

### Step 1: Setting Up MCP Configuration

The first thing we do is configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) to connect with external data sources. In this case, we're using Exa for research capabilities:

```typescript
const mcpConfig = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    exa: {
      type: "stdio",
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "mcp-remote", `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=${process.env.EXA_API_KEY}`],
    },
  },
});
```

**What this does:**

- Creates an MCP configuration that connects to Exa's research API
- Uses `stdio` type for communication between processes
- Passes your Exa API key from environment variables
- Makes Exa's search capabilities available as tools for your agents

### Step 2: Creating the Research Assistant Agent

Next, we create our first agent - the research assistant:

```typescript
const assistantAgent = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  name: "Assistant",
  instructions:
    "The user will ask you to help generate some search queries. Respond with only the suggested queries in plain text with no extra formatting, each on its own line. Use exa tools.",

  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
});
```

**Key components:**

- `id`: Unique identifier for the agent
- `instructions`: Specific instructions for generating search queries in plain text format
- `llm`: Uses Vercel AI SDK for LLM interactions
- `model`: Specifies GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective processing
- `tools`: Inherits all tools from MCP configuration (Exa search capabilities)

### Step 3: Creating the Writer Agent

The second agent is responsible for writing the final report:

```typescript
const writerAgent = new Agent({
  id: "writer",
  name: "Writer",
  instructions: "Write a report according to the user's instructions.",

  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
  markdown: true,
  maxSteps: 50,
});
```

**Design choices:**

- Uses the more powerful `gpt-4o` model for higher quality writing
- Has specialized instructions for report writing
- `markdown: true` enables markdown formatting in outputs
- `maxSteps: 50` allows for complex multi-step research and writing operations
- Also has access to MCP tools if needed for additional research

### Step 4: Defining the Workflow Structure

Now we create the workflow chain with input/output schemas:

```typescript
const workflow = createWorkflowChain({
  id: "research-assistant",
  name: "Research Assistant Workflow",
  purpose: "A simple workflow to assist with research on a given topic.",
  input: z.object({ topic: z.string() }),
  result: z.object({ text: z.string() }),
});
```

**Schema definitions:**

- `input`: Expects an object with a `topic` string
- `result`: Will output an object with a `text` string
- Uses Zod for runtime type validation and TypeScript type inference

### Step 5: Adding the Research Step

The first workflow step generates search queries:

```typescript
.andThen({
  id: "research",
  execute: async ({ data }) => {
    const { topic } = data;

    const result = await assistantAgent.generateText(
      `
      I'm writing a research report on ${topic} and need help coming up with diverse search queries.
Please generate a list of 3 search queries that would be useful for writing a research report on ${topic}. These queries can be in various formats, from simple keywords to more complex phrases. Do not add any formatting or numbering to the queries. `,
      { provider: { temperature: 1 } }
    );

    return { text: result.text };
  },
})
```

**How it works:**

1. Receives the `topic` from the workflow input
2. Uses the assistant agent to generate search queries with temperature set to 1 for more diverse results
3. Returns the queries as `text` for the next step
4. The data automatically flows to the next step in the chain

### Step 6: Adding the Writing Step

The second step creates the final report:

```typescript
.andThen({
  id: "writing",
  execute: async ({ data, getStepData }) => {
    const { text } = data;
    const stepData = getStepData("research");
    const result = await writerAgent.generateText(
      `
      Input Data: ${text}
      Write a two paragraph research report about ${stepData?.input} based on the provided information. Include as many sources as possible. Provide citations in the text using footnote notation ([#]). First provide the report, followed by a single "References" section that lists all the URLs used, in the format [#] <url>.
    `
    );

    return { text: result.text };
  },
})
```

**Advanced features:**

- `data`: Contains the output from the previous step (search queries)
- `getStepData()`: Allows accessing data from any previous step by ID
- `stepData?.input`: Gets the original input data from the research step
- The prompt instructs the agent to include citations and a references section
- Returns the final formatted report text with citations

### Step 7: Registering with VoltOps

Finally, we register everything with VoltAgent for observability:

```typescript
new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    assistant: assistantAgent,
    writer: writerAgent,
  },
  workflows: {
    assistant: workflow,
  },
  logger,
});
```

**Benefits:**

- Makes agents and workflows visible in VoltOps Console
- Enables real-time monitoring and debugging
- Provides execution traces for every workflow run
- Allows triggering workflows via REST API

## Running the Workflow

Once everything is set up, you can interact with your research assistant through the VoltOps Console. Try these example prompts:

- "Research the latest developments in quantum computing"
- "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare in 2024"
- "Investigate sustainable energy storage solutions"

The workflow will:

1. Generate relevant search queries
2. Use those queries to gather information
3. Synthesize a comprehensive report

## Key Concepts Explained

### Workflow Chaining

The `.andThen()` method creates a sequential chain where each step's output becomes the next step's input. This ensures proper data flow and maintains type safety throughout the process.

### Type Safety with Zod

Every piece of data flowing through the workflow is validated against Zod schemas. This catches errors early and provides excellent TypeScript integration with full autocomplete support.

### Step Context Access

The `getStepData()` function is powerful for accessing data from any previous step, not just the immediate predecessor. This enables complex data dependencies while maintaining clean code structure.

### Agent Collaboration

By using different agents for different tasks (research vs. writing), we can:

- Optimize model selection per task (cost vs. quality)
- Provide specialized instructions for each role
- Scale different parts of the workflow independently

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, you can:

1. **Enhance the agents**: Add more sophisticated instructions or additional tools
2. **Extend the workflow**: Add steps for fact-checking, formatting, or translation
3. **Add conditional logic**: Use `.andWhen()` to create branching workflows
4. **Implement parallel processing**: Use `.andAll()` to run multiple research queries simultaneously
5. **Add error handling**: Implement retry logic and fallback strategies
