## What is VoltAgent?

> An **AI Agent Framework** provides the foundational structure and tools needed to build applications powered by autonomous agents. These agents, often driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Building such agents from scratch involves managing complex interactions with LLMs, handling state, connecting to external tools and data, and orchestrating workflows.

**VoltAgent** is an open-source TypeScript framework that acts as this essential toolkit. It simplifies the development of AI agent applications by providing modular building blocks, standardized patterns, and abstractions. Whether you're creating chatbots, virtual assistants, automated workflows, or complex multi-agent systems, VoltAgent handles the underlying complexity, allowing you to focus on defining your agents' capabilities and logic.

Instead of building everything from scratch, VoltAgent provides ready-made, modular building blocks:

- **Core Engine (`@voltagent/core`)**: The heart of VoltAgent, providing fundamental capabilities for your AI agents Define individual agents with specific roles, tools, and memory.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Architect complex applications by coordinating multiple specialized agents using Supervisors.
- **Workflow Engine**: Go beyond simple request-response. Orchestrate multi-step automations that can process data, call APIs, run tasks in parallel, and execute conditional logic.
- **Extensible Packages**: Enhance functionality with packages like `@voltagent/voice` for voice interactions.
- **Tooling & Integrations**: Equip agents with tools to connect to external APIs, databases, and services, enabling them to perform real-world tasks. **Supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for standardized tool interactions.**
- **Data Retrieval & RAG**: Implement specialized retriever agents for efficient information fetching and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- **Memory**: Enable agents to remember past interactions for more natural and context-aware conversations.
- **LLM Compatibility**: Works with popular AI models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and more, allowing easy switching.
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Includes helpers like `create-voltagent-app`, `@voltagent/cli`, and the visual [VoltOps LLM Observability Platform](https://console.voltagent.dev) for quick setup, monitoring, and debugging.

In essence, VoltAgent helps developers build sophisticated AI applications faster and more reliably, avoiding repetitive setup and the limitations of simpler tools.

## Why VoltAgent?

Building AI applications often involves a trade-off:

1.  **DIY Approach:** Using basic AI provider tools offers control but leads to complex, hard-to-manage code and repeated effort.
2.  **No-Code Builders:** Simpler initially but often restrictive, limiting customization, provider choice, and complexity.

VoltAgent provides a middle ground, offering structure and components without sacrificing flexibility:

- **Build Faster:** Accelerate development with pre-built components compared to starting from scratch.
- **Maintainable Code:** Encourages organization for easier updates and debugging.
- **Scalability:** Start simple and easily scale to complex, multi-agent systems handling intricate workflows.
- **Build Sophisticated Automations:** It's not just for chat. The workflow engine lets you build complex, multi-step processes for tasks like data analysis pipelines, automated content generation, or intelligent decision-making systems.
- **Flexibility:** Full control over agent behavior, LLM choice, tool integrations, and UI connections.
- **Avoid Lock-in:** Freedom to switch AI providers and models as needed.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Features designed to optimize AI service usage and reduce redundant calls.
- **Visual Monitoring:** Use the [VoltOps LLM Observability Platform](https://console.voltagent.dev) to track agent performance, inspect state, and debug visually.

VoltAgent empowers developers to build their envisioned AI applications efficiently, from simple helpers to complex systems.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Create a new VoltAgent project in seconds using the `create-voltagent-app` CLI tool:

```bash
npm create voltagent-app@latest
```

This command guides you through setup.

You'll see the starter code in `src/index.ts`, which now registers both an agent and a comprehensive workflow example found in `src/workflows/index.ts`.

```typescript
import { VoltAgent, Agent } from "@voltagent/core";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { comprehensiveWorkflow } from "./workflows";

// A simple, general-purpose agent for the project.
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "my-agent",
  instructions: "A helpful assistant that answers questions without using tools",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: [],
});

// Initialize VoltAgent with your agent(s) and workflow(s)
new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    agent,
  },
  workflows: {
    comprehensiveWorkflow,
  },
});
```

Afterwards, navigate to your project and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

When you run the dev command, tsx will compile and run your code. You should see the VoltAgent server startup message in your terminal:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
VOLTAGENT SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
✓ HTTP Server: http://localhost:3141

Test your agents with VoltOps Console: https://console.voltagent.dev
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Your agent is now running! To interact with it:

1. Open the Console: Click the [VoltOps LLM Observability Platform](https://console.voltagent.dev) link in your terminal output (or copy-paste it into your browser).
2. Find Your Agent: On the VoltOps LLM Observability Platform page, you should see your agent listed (e.g., "my-agent").
3. Open Agent Details: Click on your agent's name.
4. Start Chatting: On the agent detail page, click the chat icon in the bottom right corner to open the chat window.
5. Send a Message: Type a message like "Hello" and press Enter.

### Running Your First Workflow

Your new project also includes a powerful workflow engine. You can test the pre-built `comprehensiveWorkflow` directly from the VoltOps console:

![VoltOps Workflow Observability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b877c65-f095-407f-9237-d7879964c38a)

1.  **Go to the Workflows Page:** After starting your server, go directly to the [Workflows page](https://console.voltagent.dev/workflows).
2.  **Select Your Project:** Use the project selector to choose your project (e.g., "my-agent-app").
3.  **Find and Run:** You will see **"Comprehensive Workflow Example"** listed. Click it, then click the **"Run"** button.
4.  **Provide Input:** The workflow expects a JSON object with a `text` key. Try it with a negative sentiment to see the conditional logic in action:
    ```json
    { "text": "I am very disappointed with this product, it is terrible." }
    ```
5.  **View the Results:** After execution, you can inspect the detailed logs for each step and see the final output directly in the console.
